Steps to create a Hello World Application

1. Run "pip install Django" on commandline to install Django
2. You can run "python -m django --version" to check if Django got installed
3. cd into the directory where you want to setup your project
4. Run the command "django-admin startproject hello_world_app" to create a django project folder named hello_world_app
5. cd into the "hello_world_app" directory
6. Verify your django project works by running the command "python manage.py runserver"
7. Youll get an output with a url where your development server is running on, open the url to check your project
8. By default the server will run on port 8000, but if u want to change you can do it by "python manage.py runserver 8080" for port 8080 or any port
9. To create the hello world application in the same directory run the command "python manage.py startapp main_app"
10. Inside views.py in main_app directory import HttpResponse from django.http 
    and define a view as follows which returns a Hello world response

    *This will be the views.py inside main_app*

        from django.http import HttpResponse

        def index(request):
            return HttpResponse("Hello World, how are ya?")

11. Create a file named urls.py in main_app directory
12. Map the view created previously to index url by writing the following code in urls.py just created

    *urls.py inside main_app*

        from django.urls import path
        from . import views

        urlpatterns = [
            path('', views.index, name='index'),
        ]

13. Add the following code in the hello_world_app/urls.py file

    *urls.py inside hello_world_app*

        from django.contrib import admin
        from django.urls import include, path

        urlpatterns = [
            path('', include('main_app.urls')),
            path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
        ]

14. Check whether the index view is connected by running the following command again "python manage.py runserver"
15. Open http://127.0.0.1.8000/ and youll be able to see the response "Hello World, how are ya?"
